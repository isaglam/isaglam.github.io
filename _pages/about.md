I am currently pursuing my PhD at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS)](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) under the joint supervision of [Georg Zetzsche](http://zetzsche.xyz) and [Anne-Kathrin Schmuck](https://wp.mpi-sws.org/akschmuck/). I am a part of Models of Computation and [Control Software Systems](https://cossy.mpi-sws.org/) groups, headed by my advisors.

My main research focus lies in logic, automata and games, (mostly) with verification and synthesis in mind.
Right now, my work generally revolves around games on finite graphs, aiming to understand them better and discover efficient ways to tackle them. Fairness constraints on such games are of special interest to me and I'm keen on identifying inexpensive fairness constraints for specific game/graph categories.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the [Computer Engineering Department](https://ceng.metu.edu.tr) of [Middle East Technical University (METU)](https://www.metu.edu.tr) and my Master's degree from the [Mathematics Department](https://math.metu.edu.tr) of the same institution. During my Master's studies I was advised by [Burak Kaya](https://blog.metu.edu.tr/burakk/). You can access my Master's thesis [here](https://open.metu.edu.tr/bitstream/handle/11511/89646/12625986.pdf). Concurrently with my Master's studies, I had the opportunity to work with [Ebru Ayd\in GÃ¶l](https://cps.ceng.metu.edu.tr/people/ebru-aydin-gol/) from METU Computer Engineering. Our joint research was a part of the work conducted by the [Cyber-Physical Systems Research Group](https://cps.ceng.metu.edu.tr).
