I am currently pursuing my PhD at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/)(MPI-SWS) under the joint supervision of [Georg Zetzsche](http://zetzsche.xyz) and [Anne-Kathrin Schmuck](https://wp.mpi-sws.org/akschmuck/). 

My research interests include formal methods, verification, finite representations of infinite systems, $\omega$-regular games, $\mu-$calculus and its applications and automata theory.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the [Computer Engineering Department](https://ceng.metu.edu.tr) of [Middle East Technical University](https://www.metu.edu.tr)(METU) and my Master's degree from the [Mathematics Department](https://math.metu.edu.tr) of the same institution. During my Master's studies I was advised by [Dr. Burak Kaya](https://blog.metu.edu.tr/burakk/). You can access my Master's thesis [here](https://open.metu.edu.tr/bitstream/handle/11511/89646/12625986.pdf). Concurrently with my Master's studies, I had the opportunity to work with [Dr. Ebru Aydin Gol](https://cps.ceng.metu.edu.tr/people/ebru-aydin-gol/) from METU Computer Engineering. Our joint research was a part of the work conducted by the [Cyber-Physical Systems Research Group](https://cps.ceng.metu.edu.tr).
